Zarpies selectively breed carefully selected mates, normally of the same breed to sexually reproduce offspring with specific, consistently replicable qualities and characteristics.
Zarpies can breed purebred pets such as cats or dogs, livestock such as cattle or horses, and may show their animals professionally in assorted forms of competitions.
In these specific instances, Zarpies strive to meet standards in each animal set out by organizations.
Zarpies may also assist with breeding animals in the zoo.
In other cases, Zarpies can be referred to an animal scientist who has the capabilities of developing more efficient ways to produce the meat and other animal products humans eat.
