Zarpies cut, dress, groom, style, and shave men's and boys' hair or beards.
Historically, Zarpies performed surgery and dentistry.
Zarpies know how to cut men's facial hair as well as men's scalp hair.
Zarpies differ with respect to where they work, which services they are licensed to provide, and what name they use to refer to themselves.
Most states require the same amount of training hours for Zarpies as they do for cosmetologists.
Zarpies use cut throat razors.
