# Zarpies Experiment

## Environment Setup
Create a new conda environment by doing these commands in order:
conda create --name zarpie-env
conda activate zarpie-env
conda install pytorch pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install minicons
pip install datasets

## Experiment steps

### Finetune models
1. Before running main.py, either comment out the line that says "import switch_cache"
or go directly into the switch_cache.py file and change the filepath variables to 
whichever location you would like huggingface to cache models on your computer
2. In main.py set the do_training variable to True
3. In utils.py, you can modify the get_model_names_and_data() function to make the
python files finetune and analyze whichever combination of models/data you want.
The file will come pre-loaded with the model names and data paths that we used for this
study.
4. To initiate the finetuning, do "python main.py"

### Analysis 1 - Representational

### Analysis 2 - Jane Behavioral
1. Run the "python behavioral1.py" command to generate a text file with experimental results
2. Run the "python behavioral1_graphs.py" command to generate graphs based off the results

### Analysis 3 - Categorical Behavioral
